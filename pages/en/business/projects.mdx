# Projects

Understanding how projects help organize your documents and teams.

---

## What is a Project?

A project is a way to group related documents and people together. Think of it as a folder that also knows who should have access to its contents.

{/* SCREENSHOT: projects-page.png
     Capture the Projects page showing:
     - Grid of project cards
     - Project names and descriptions
     - Status badges on cards
     - Create Project button (if user has permission)
     - Browser window: 1400x800
*/}

### Projects Help You

- **Stay organized** — Keep related documents together
- **Control access** — Only project members see project documents
- **Track progress** — Project status shows where things stand
- **Collaborate** — Teams are assigned at the project level

---

## Viewing Your Projects

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. You'll see all projects you're a member of

Each project card shows:
- **Name** — The project title
- **Description** — What the project is about
- **Status** — Current state (Active, Completed, etc.)

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-card.png
     Capture a single project card showing:
     - Project name
     - Description text
     - Status badge
     - Any member avatars if shown
*/}

---

## Project Status

Projects have a status that shows where they are:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Currently in progress |
| **On Hold** | Temporarily paused |
| **Completed** | Finished successfully |
| **Archived** | No longer active, kept for reference |

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-statuses.png
     Capture projects page showing projects with different statuses:
     - At least one Active
     - At least one other status (Completed or Archived)
     - Shows how status badges look
*/}

---

## Viewing Project Details

Click on any project card to see its details.

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-detail.png
     Capture a project detail page showing:
     - Project name and description
     - Status
     - Start/end dates if shown
     - Team members or teams
     - Documents in this project
*/}

### What You'll See

- **Overview** — Project information and status
- **Documents** — All documents in this project
- **Team** — Members and their roles
- **Activity** — Recent changes in this project

---

## Finding Documents in a Project

### From the Project Page

1. Open the project
2. Browse the documents listed there

### From the Documents Page

1. Go to **Documents**
2. Use the **Project** filter dropdown
3. Select the project you want

{/* SCREENSHOT: filter-by-project.png
     Capture the Documents page showing:
     - The Project filter dropdown open
     - List of projects to select from
*/}

This shows only documents from that project.

---

## Project Members

Each project has members — the people who can access it.

### Member Roles

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| **Member** | View and work with project documents |
| **Admin** | Manage the project settings |
| **Owner** | Full control, including deleting the project |

### Seeing Who's in a Project

Open the project and look for the Team or Members section.

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-members.png
     Capture the project members section showing:
     - List of members
     - Their roles
     - Avatar images if available
*/}

---

## Teams and Projects

Teams can be assigned to projects to give a group of people access.

### How It Works

1. A team is created (e.g., "Marketing Team")
2. The team is assigned to a project
3. All team members can now access that project

### Benefits

- Easier to manage access for groups
- When someone joins a team, they get project access automatically
- When someone leaves, their access is removed automatically

## Creating a Project

> **Note:** You need Project Manager or Admin role to create projects.

## Project Best Practices

### Good Project Names

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "Project 1" | "2024 Marketing Campaign" |
| "New project" | "Website Redesign - Phase 2" |
| "Stuff" | "Q4 Sales Documents" |

### Clear Descriptions

Write descriptions that tell people:
- What the project is about
- What kind of documents it contains
- Any important context

### Keep Projects Focused

One project = one initiative or goal. If things get too broad, consider creating separate projects.

### Archive When Done

Don't delete completed projects — archive them. This keeps the history available if needed later.

---

## Common Questions

### Can a document be in multiple projects?

No, each document belongs to one project. If you need a document in multiple places, consider:
- Choosing the most appropriate project
- Creating links or references in comments

### What happens when I lose project access?

If you're removed from a project, you lose access to:
- The project page
- All documents in that project
- Comments and history in that project

### Can I move documents between projects?

Yes, if you have permission. Edit the document and change the Project field.

### What happens to documents when a project is archived?

Documents remain accessible but the project is marked as archived. You can still view and download documents.
