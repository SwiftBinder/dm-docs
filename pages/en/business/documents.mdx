# Working with Documents

A simple guide to managing your documents in Document Manager.

---

## Understanding Documents

In Document Manager, a document is more than just a file. It includes:

- **The file itself** — The actual content (PDF, Word doc, spreadsheet, etc.)
- **Metadata** — Name, description, tags, and other information
- **Versions** — History of all changes over time
- **Comments** — Discussions and feedback from your team

---

## Browsing Documents

### The Document List

Click **Documents** in the sidebar to see all documents you have access to.

{/* SCREENSHOT: documents-list-table.png
     Capture the Documents page showing:
     - Table view with multiple documents
     - Columns: Name, Status, Tags, Modified date
     - Pagination at bottom
     - Filter toolbar at top
     - Browser window: 1400x800
*/}

### Switching Views

You can view documents as a table or as cards:

- **Table View** — See more documents at once, good for scanning
- **Grid View** — Larger previews, more visual

{/* SCREENSHOT: view-toggle.png
     Capture the view toggle buttons showing:
     - Table view icon
     - Grid view icon
     - Current view highlighted
*/}

Click the view icons at the top right to switch.

## Document Status

Every document has a status that shows its current state:

     Capture a document with Draft status showing:
     - The Draft badge clearly visible
     - Crop to focus on the status area
*/}

- Work in progress
- Still being edited
- Not finalized

### Published

{/* SCREENSHOT: status-published.png

     - The Published badge clearly visible
*/}

- Complete and approved
- Ready for use
- Final version

### Archived

{/* SCREENSHOT: status-archived.png
     Capture a document with Archived status showing:
     - The Archived badge clearly visible
*/}

- No longer active
- Kept for historical reference
- Can be restored if needed

---

## Changing Status

If you have permission:

1. Open the document
2. Click **Edit**
3. Change the status dropdown
4. Save

Common status workflows:

```
Draft → Published (when complete)
Published → Archived (when no longer needed)
Archived → Draft (to revive for updates)
```

## Using Tags

Tags are labels that help organize and find documents.

### Good Tag Examples

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `contract` | Legal documents |
| `2024` | Year for reference |
| `urgent` | Needs immediate attention |
| `client-abc` | Related to a specific client |
| `final` | Finalized documents |

### Adding Tags

1. Open the document
2. Click **Edit**
3. Type in the Tags field
4. Press Enter after each tag
5. Save

### Finding by Tag

1. Go to **Tags** in the sidebar
2. Click any tag to see related documents

Or use the filter on the Documents page.

## Editing Document Information

You can update a document's metadata at any time:

1. Open the document
2. Click **Edit** or click on a field to edit inline
3. Make your changes:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Status
   - Tags
4. Save

{/* SCREENSHOT: document-edit-mode.png
     Capture the document in edit mode showing:
     - Editable fields
     - Save/Cancel buttons
     - Fields highlighted as editable
*/}

> **Note:** Editing metadata does not create a new version. Only uploading a new file creates a version.

---

## Downloading Documents

### Download the Current Version

Click the **Download** button on the document page.

### Download a Specific Version

1. Go to the **Versions** tab
2. Find the version you need
3. Click the download icon

---

## Deleting Documents

If you have permission:

1. Open the document
2. Click the **Delete** button (or find it in the menu)
3. Confirm the deletion

{/* SCREENSHOT: delete-confirmation.png
     Capture the delete confirmation dialog showing:
     - Warning message
     - Confirm/Cancel buttons
*/}

> **Note:** Deleted documents are soft-deleted, meaning they can be recovered by an administrator if needed.

## Tips for Good Document Management

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| `doc1.pdf` | `Q4-Sales-Report-2024.pdf` |
| `final_final_v2.docx` | `Project-Proposal-v3.docx` |
| `notes.txt` | `Meeting-Notes-2024-01-15.txt` |

### Descriptions

Write descriptions that answer:
- What is this document?
- What is it used for?
- Any important context?

### Tags Strategy

Agree with your team on standard tags:
- By type: `contract`, `report`, `proposal`
- By year: `2024`, `2025`
- By status: `urgent`, `review-needed`
- By department: `sales`, `engineering`, `hr`

## Common Questions

### Can I upload multiple files at once?

Currently, documents are uploaded one at a time. Each document is tracked separately with its own versions and comments.

### What file types are supported?

Document Manager accepts all common file types: PDFs, Office documents, images, and more. Check with your administrator for any specific restrictions.

### How large can files be?

File size limits are set by your administrator. If you receive an error about file size, try compressing the file or contact your admin.

### Can I move a document to a different project?

Yes, edit the document and change the Project field.
