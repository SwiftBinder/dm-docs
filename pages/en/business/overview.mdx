A simple introduction to Document Manager for everyday users.

## What is Document Manager?

Document Manager is a secure, centralized place for your team to:

- **Store documents** — Keep all files in one organized location
- **Track changes** — See who changed what and when
- **Work together** — Discuss documents with your team
- **Stay organized** — Use projects and tags to find things quickly

Think of it as a smart filing cabinet that remembers everything and helps your team collaborate.

## Key Benefits

### Never Lose a Version

Every time someone updates a document, the previous version is saved. You can:
- See all past versions
- Download any version
- Go back to an earlier version if needed

### Know Who Did What

Document Manager tracks all activity:
- Who uploaded a document
- Who made changes
- When changes happened

### Work as a Team

Instead of emailing files back and forth:
- Everyone accesses the same document
- Leave comments and feedback
- Discuss changes in one place

### Find Documents Fast

No more digging through folders:
- Search by name or content
- Filter by project, status, or tags
- See your recent documents instantly

## Document Status Explained

Documents have a status that shows where they are in their lifecycle:

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress, not yet final |
| **Published** | Finalized and ready for use |
| **Archived** | No longer active, but kept for reference |

{/* SCREENSHOT: document-status-badges.png
     Capture a document list showing different status badges:
     - At least one Draft document
     - At least one Published document
     - At least one Archived document if possible
     - Focus on the status column/badges
*/}

## How Documents, Projects, and Teams Connect

```
Project
├── Team A (with specific permissions)
├── Team B (with specific permissions)
└── Documents
    ├── Document 1
    ├── Document 2
    └── Document 3 (each with versions and comments)
```

- **Projects** contain documents
- **Teams** are assigned to projects
- **Documents** belong to projects and have versions
