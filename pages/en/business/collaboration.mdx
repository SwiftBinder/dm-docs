# Collaboration

How to work with your team using comments and discussions in Document Manager.

---

## Why Collaborate in Document Manager?

Instead of:
- Sending files back and forth via email
- Losing track of which version has the latest comments
- Searching through email threads for feedback

You can:
- Keep all comments attached to the document
- See the full discussion history in one place
- Know exactly which version someone commented on

---

## Comments

Comments let you discuss documents with your team directly in the system.

### Adding a Comment

1. Open any document
2. Click the **Comments** tab
3. Type your comment in the text box
4. Click **Post**

{/* SCREENSHOT: comment-input.png
     Capture the Comments tab showing:
     - Empty or with existing comments
     - The comment text input area
     - The Post button
     - Clean, focused view
*/}

Your comment is now visible to everyone who can access this document.

### What to Use Comments For

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Ask a question | "Is this the final approved version?" |
| Give feedback | "Section 3 needs more detail on costs." |
| Request changes | "Please update the date on page 2." |
| Provide updates | "I've addressed all the review comments." |
| Approval | "Reviewed and approved by the legal team." |

## Comment Threads

When someone replies to a comment, it creates a thread — a conversation grouped together.

### Replying to a Comment

1. Find the comment you want to respond to
2. Click **Reply**
3. Type your response
4. Click **Post**

{/* SCREENSHOT: comment-reply.png
     Capture a comment thread showing:
     - Original comment
     - Reply button
     - At least one reply indented below
     - Shows the threaded nature of the conversation
*/}

Replies appear indented under the original comment, keeping the conversation organized.

### Thread Etiquette

- **Reply to the right comment** — Click Reply on the specific comment you're responding to
- **Start new threads for new topics** — Don't reply to an old thread with an unrelated question
- **Be clear** — Reference specific sections or pages when giving feedback

## Resolving Comments

When a discussion is complete or feedback has been addressed, you can mark a comment as resolved.

### How to Resolve

1. Find the comment
2. Click the **Resolve** button (or checkmark icon)

{/* SCREENSHOT: resolve-comment.png
     Capture a comment showing:
     - The Resolve button or checkmark
     - Before and after states if possible
*/}

### What Happens When Resolved

- The comment is marked as resolved
- By default, resolved comments are hidden
- You can show resolved comments using the filter

### When to Resolve

- The question has been answered
- The requested change has been made
- The discussion is complete

> **Tip:** Resolving comments keeps the Comments tab clean and focused on active discussions.

---

## Viewing Comment History

### See All Comments

The Comments tab shows all active comments by default.

### Show Resolved Comments

To see comments that have been resolved:

1. Look for a filter or toggle option
2. Select "Show resolved" or similar option

{/* SCREENSHOT: show-resolved-toggle.png
     Capture the Comments tab showing:
     - A toggle or filter for showing resolved comments
     - Or the interface to access resolved comments
*/}

This lets you see the full discussion history when needed.

---

## Notifications

When someone comments on a document you're involved with, you may receive a notification.

### Checking Notifications

1. Look for the bell icon in the top bar
2. Click to see recent activity
3. Click any notification to go to that document

{/* SCREENSHOT: notifications-dropdown.png
     Capture the notifications area showing:
     - Bell icon
     - Dropdown with notification items
     - Sample notifications about comments
*/}

### Notification Settings

You can adjust what you're notified about in Settings:

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Find the **Notifications** section
3. Choose your preferences

## Best Practices for Collaboration

### Be Specific

Instead of:
> "This needs changes."

Try:
> "The budget figures in Table 3 need to be updated with Q4 actuals."

### Use Threads Appropriately

- One topic per thread
- Reply to continue a conversation
- Start a new comment for a new topic

### Resolve When Done

- Mark comments as resolved when addressed
- Keeps the active list manageable
- Shows progress to the team

### Check Comments Before Uploading New Versions

Before uploading a new version:
1. Review all open comments
2. Address feedback
3. Mention what you've changed

Example comment:
> "Uploaded v3 — addressed all comments from the review:
> - Updated Table 3 with Q4 figures
> - Fixed typos on pages 5 and 8
> - Added executive summary"

## Collaboration Workflow Example

Here's how a typical review might work:

```
1. Author uploads document (v1)
       ↓
2. Reviewer adds comment: "Need more detail in section 2"
       ↓
3. Author replies: "Good point, I'll expand that section"
       ↓
4. Author uploads new version (v2) with changes
       ↓
5. Author comments: "Updated section 2, please review"
       ↓
6. Reviewer reviews and resolves the comment
       ↓
7. Reviewer adds new comment: "Approved - ready to publish"
       ↓
8. Author changes status to Published
```
