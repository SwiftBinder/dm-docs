# System Monitoring

Complete guide to monitoring Document Manager — activity logs, audit trails, and system health.

## Activity Monitoring

### System-Wide Activity

Unlike regular users, administrators see all system activity:

| What Admins See | What Users See |
|-----------------|----------------|
| All documents | Only accessible documents |
| All users' actions | Only related actions |
| All projects | Only member projects |
| All comments | Only accessible comments |

### Accessing Activity Logs

1. Click **Activities** in the sidebar
2. View the complete activity timeline
3. Use filters to focus on specific areas

## Filtering and Analysis

### Available Filters

{/* SCREENSHOT: admin-activity-filters.png
     Capture the filter options showing:
     - Resource type filter
     - Date range
     - User filter
     - Event type filter
*/}

| Filter | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| **Resource Type** | Focus on documents, projects, users |
| **Date Range** | Investigate specific periods |
| **User** | Audit specific user activity |
| **Event Type** | Filter to specific actions |

### Filter Strategies

**Security Review:**
- Filter: Login events
- Date: Last 7 days
- Look for: Failed attempts, unusual times

**Document Audit:**
- Filter: Documents
- Event: Downloads, deletions
- Look for: Mass actions, sensitive files

**User Audit:**
- Filter: Specific user
- Date: Employment period
- Look for: All activity during tenure

## Audit Trail

### What Gets Logged

Every activity record includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | Exact date and time (with timezone) |
| **User** | Who performed the action |
| **Event Type** | What type of action |
| **Resource** | What was affected |
| **Details** | Additional context |
| **IP Address** | Where action originated |

### Log Retention

| Aspect | Typical Policy |
|--------|----------------|
| Duration | Check with your organization |
| Storage | System database |
| Archive | May be available |
| Export | Check system capabilities |

### Compliance Use

Activity logs support:
- SOC 2 compliance
- GDPR data access tracking
- Internal audit requirements
- Security incident investigation

---

## Notification Count

### Unread Notifications

Monitor the notification count for:
- System alerts
- Important events
- User-reported issues

{/* SCREENSHOT: notification-count.png

## System Health

### Health Indicators

> **Note:** Detailed health monitoring may require backend access.

### Application Health

| Check | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **API Response** | Backend is functioning |
| **Login Success** | Authentication working |
| **Upload Success** | Storage is operational |
| **Search Works** | Database is responsive |

### Monitoring Approach

1. Regularly test key functions
2. Watch for user-reported issues
3. Check activity for error patterns
4. Monitor system performance

## Security Monitoring

### Suspicious Activity Patterns

| Pattern | Possible Issue |
|---------|----------------|
| Multiple failed logins | Brute force attempt |
| Off-hours activity | Unauthorized access |
| Mass downloads | Data exfiltration |
| Unusual role changes | Privilege escalation |
| Rapid deletions | Malicious destruction |

### What to Do

When suspicious activity detected:

1. **Document** — Note the pattern
2. **Investigate** — Check user, context
3. **Contain** — Deactivate account if needed
4. **Report** — Follow incident procedure
5. **Remediate** — Fix vulnerabilities
6. **Review** — Update monitoring

   - Revoke suspicious sessions
   - Block further damage

3. **Investigate thoroughly**
   - Review activity logs
   - Identify scope
   - Determine root cause

4. **Document everything**
   - Timeline of events
   - Actions taken
   - Evidence preserved

5. **Report appropriately**
   - Follow organizational procedure
