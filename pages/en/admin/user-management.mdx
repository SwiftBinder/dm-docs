### Changing User Roles

To change a user's role:

## Deactivating Users

### When to Deactivate

- Employee leaves the organization
- Account no longer needed
- Security concern
- Temporary suspension

### What Happens

When a user is deactivated:
- They cannot log in
- Existing sessions are invalidated
- Their data remains intact
- They keep project memberships (but can't access)

### Deactivation vs Deletion

| Aspect | Deactivate | Delete |
|--------|------------|--------|
| User can log in | No | No |
| Data preserved | Yes | Depends on policy |
| Reversible | Yes | Usually no |
| Audit trail | Preserved | May be removed |

**Recommendation:** Always prefer deactivation over deletion.

## Reactivating Users

### When to Reactivate

- Employee returns
- Suspension ends
- Account needed again

### Reactivation Process

1. Find the inactive user (may need to filter)
2. Click **Activate** or toggle status
3. Confirm

The user can now log in again with existing credentials.

### Resetting User Passwords

If a user forgets their password:
