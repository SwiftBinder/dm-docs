## Document Branching

### What Is It?

Git-like branching for documents — create parallel versions for different purposes without affecting the main document.

### How It Would Work

```
Main Document (v1.0)
    │
    ├── Branch: "Legal Review"
    │   └── v1.0.1, v1.0.2 (legal changes)
    │
    └── Branch: "Translation"
        └── v1.0.1 (Spanish version)
```

### Use Cases

| Scenario | How Branching Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| Multiple reviewers | Each reviewer works on own branch |
| Translations | Each language as a branch |
| Client variations | Branch per client customization |
| A/B testing | Different versions to compare |

### Planned Features

- Create branches from any version
- Name branches meaningfully
- Merge branches back to main
- Compare branch differences
- Track branch activity

### Status

**Planning Phase** — We're gathering requirements

### Your Feedback Needed

- Would you use branching?
- What scenarios would you use it for?
- How many branches per document would you need?
