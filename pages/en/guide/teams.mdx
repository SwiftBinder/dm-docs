# Teams

Complete guide to team management — creating teams, managing members, and project assignments.

## Overview

Teams are groups of users who work together. Instead of managing project access person by person, you can assign entire teams to projects.

## Assigning Teams to Projects

### How It Works

When a team is assigned to a project:
- All team members get project access
- Access level depends on permission setting
- Changes to team membership automatically affect project access

### Assigning from Project

1. Open the project
2. Go to **Teams** section
3. Click **Assign Team**
4. Select team and permission level

### Viewing Team's Projects

On the team detail page, see which projects the team is assigned to.

{/* SCREENSHOT: team-projects-list.png
     Capture the team's project list showing:
     - Projects the team is assigned to
     - Permission levels for each
*/}

### Permission Levels

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **View** | Read-only access to project documents |
| **Edit** | Can create and modify documents |
| **Manage** | Full project management |

---

## Team Settings

### Editing Team Information

1. Open the team
2. Click **Edit** or **Settings**
3. Modify:
   - Name
   - Description
4. Save changes

### Team Visibility

Teams are visible to:
- Team members
- Project managers (for projects the team is in)
- Administrators

---

## Deleting Teams

### When to Delete

- Team is no longer needed
- Organizational restructure
- Duplicate team created

### Before Deleting

Consider:
- Remove from projects first
- Ensure members have individual access if needed
- Archive vs delete

### Deletion Process

1. Open the team
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm

{/* SCREENSHOT: delete-team-confirm.png
     Capture the delete confirmation showing:
     - Warning message
     - Impact explanation
     - Confirm/Cancel buttons
*/}

### What Happens

- Team is removed
- Members lose project access via this team
- Individual project memberships remain unaffected

## Team Best Practices

### Organization

- **Align with org structure** — Mirror your department/function teams
- **Purpose-based teams** — Create teams for specific initiatives
- **Reasonable size** — Not too large, not too small

### Naming Conventions

Consistent naming helps everyone:
```
{Department} - {Function/Specialty}

Examples:
Marketing - Content
Engineering - Frontend
Sales - West Region
```

### Membership Management

- **Regular audits** — Review membership quarterly
- **Onboarding** — Add new hires to appropriate teams
- **Offboarding** — Remove departing employees promptly

### Project Assignment

- **Appropriate access** — Only assign to projects where needed
- **Correct permissions** — Match permission level to need
- **Review regularly** — Update as project needs change
