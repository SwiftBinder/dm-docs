## Document Status

3. Change the Status dropdown
4. Save

### Status Workflow

Typical document lifecycle:

```
       ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
       │                                 │
       v                                 │
    [Draft] ──────> [Published] ──────> [Archived]
       │                │                 │
       │                │                 │
       └────────────────┴─────────────────┘
                   (can go back)
```

### Status Best Practices

## Working with Tags

### What Tags Are

Tags are keywords that help categorize and find documents.

### Adding Tags

When creating or editing a document:
1. Find the Tags field
2. Type a tag name
3. Press Enter or comma to add
4. Repeat for more tags

{/* SCREENSHOT: tags-input.png

     - Input area for new tags
*/}

### Removing Tags

Click the X on any tag to remove it.

### Tag Best Practices

| Good Tags | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `contract` | Clear category |
| `2024` | Easy year filtering |
| `client-acme` | Specific client reference |
| `final` | Status indicator |

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `important` | Too vague |
| `misc` | Not helpful for searching |
| `document` | Redundant |

Bad:  "report.pdf"
```

- Its purpose
- Any important context

### Organization

- Assign to appropriate projects
- Use consistent tags
- Update status as work progresses

### Maintenance

- Archive completed work
- Delete obsolete documents
- Keep descriptions current
