## Understanding Activities

### What Gets Tracked

| Category | Events |
|----------|--------|
| **Documents** | Created, updated, deleted, downloaded |
| **Versions** | Uploaded, rolled back, downloaded |
| **Comments** | Added, edited, resolved, deleted |
| **Projects** | Created, updated, archived, deleted |
| **Users** | Logged in, profile updated |
| **Teams** | Created, members added/removed |

### Why Activity Tracking Matters

- **Audit compliance** — Know who did what and when
- **Collaboration awareness** — See team activity
- **Troubleshooting** — Understand what changed
- **Security** — Detect unusual activity
