# Projects

Complete guide to project management — creating, organizing, and managing project workspaces.

## Overview

Projects are the primary way to organize documents and control access in Document Manager. Each project is a container that groups related documents and defines who can work with them.

### Creation Process

1. Go to **Projects**
2. Click **Create Project**

{/* SCREENSHOT: create-project-form.png
     Capture the Create Project dialog showing:
     - Name field
     - Description field
     - Version format dropdown
     - Project template dropdown
     - Naming template section
     - Create button
*/}

3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Description | Required |

| **Name** | Clear project title | Yes |
| **Description** | What the project is about | Recommended |
| **Version Format** | How versions are numbered | Yes |
| **Project Template** | Pre-configured stages and settings | Optional |
| **Naming Template** | Automatic document naming pattern | Optional |

4. Click **Create**

### Version Formats

Choose how document versions are numbered in this project:

| Format | Example | Best For |

| **Semantic** | 1.2.3 (major.minor.patch) | Technical documents, software |
| **Two-Part** | 1.2 (major.minor) | General documents |
| **Integer** | 1, 2, 3... | Simple sequential versioning |

### Project Templates

Templates provide pre-configured settings for common project types:

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-template-select.png
     Capture the template selection showing:
     - Template dropdown
     - Template description
     - Stage workflow preview
*/}

Available templates typically include:
- **Standard Documentation** — Basic draft → review → published workflow
- **Technical Approval** — Multi-stage technical review process
- **Quick Publication** — Minimal stages for fast turnaround

> **Tip:** Your organization may have custom templates. Ask your administrator about available options.

### Naming Templates

Configure automatic document naming with variables:

{/* SCREENSHOT: naming-template-config.png
     Capture naming template showing:
     - Variable list (Project, Date, Counter, etc.)
     - Separator selection
     - Live preview of generated filename
*/}

Variables you can use:
- `{project}` — Project name or code
- `{date}` — Current date
- `{customer}` — Customer name
- `{counter}` — Auto-incrementing number
- Custom variables defined by your admin

Example: `{project}-{date}-{counter}` → `PROJ-2024-001`

### Naming Best Practices

| Good Names | Bad Names |
|------------|-----------|
| "2024 Marketing Campaign" | "Project 1" |
| "Client ABC - Website Redesign" | "New project" |
| "Q4 Sales Documentation" | "Stuff" |

## Project Documents

### Viewing Project Documents

On the project detail page, you'll find multiple ways to view and manage documents.

### Kanban Board View

Projects with stage templates show a Kanban board for visual document management:

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-kanban-board.png
     Capture the Kanban board showing:
     - Columns for each stage (Draft, Review, Published, etc.)
     - Document cards in each column
     - Drag handles on cards
     - Document counts per column
*/}

**Using the Kanban Board:**
- **View stages** — Each column represents a workflow stage
- **Drag documents** — Move cards between columns to change stage
- **Quick access** — Click any card to open the document
- **Progress overview** — See at a glance where documents are in the workflow

### Document List

Below the Kanban (or as the main view for projects without stages):

{/* SCREENSHOT: project-documents-list.png
     Capture showing:
     - Document list within project
     - Status, name, modified date
     - Quick actions
*/}

### Filtering by Project

From the main Documents page:

1. Use the **Project** filter
2. Select a project
3. See only that project's documents

{/* SCREENSHOT: filter-documents-by-project.png

     - Project filter dropdown open

### Adding Documents to a Project

## Deleting Projects

### Deletion Process

## Project Best Practices

### Planning

- **Define scope clearly** — One initiative per project
- **Set realistic dates** — Use start/end dates for planning
- **Write good descriptions** — Help team understand the purpose

### Organization

- **Consistent naming** — Follow a naming convention
- **Appropriate status** — Update status as work progresses
- **Regular cleanup** — Archive completed projects

### Access Control

- **Minimal access** — Only add members who need access
- **Use teams** — Easier management than individual members
- **Review periodically** — Remove people who no longer need access

### Lifecycle

```
1. Create project (Active)
       ↓
2. Add members/teams
       ↓
3. Upload documents, collaborate
       ↓
4. Work progresses...
       ↓
