## Quick Access

The sidebar provides instant access to common document groups.

{/* SCREENSHOT: quick-access-sidebar.png
     Capture the Quick Access section showing:
     - Starred
     - Recent

## Tags for Discovery

### Using Tags Page

2. See all available tags
3. Click a tag to filter documents

{/* SCREENSHOT: tags-for-search.png
     Capture the Tags page showing:
     - Tags as clickable items
     - Document counts
     - Search within tags
*/}

### Tag-Based Search Strategy

When you know the category but not the name:

1. Go to Tags
2. Find relevant tag (e.g., "contract")
3. Click to see all matching documents
4. Use additional filters to narrow down

## View Modes

### Table vs Grid View

Switch between views using the toggle icons:

| View | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Table** | Scanning many documents, seeing details |
| **Grid** | Visual browsing, fewer documents |

{/* SCREENSHOT: view-mode-comparison.png
     Capture both views or the toggle showing:
     - Table view icon
     - Grid view icon
     - Current selection
*/}

Your view preference is saved automatically.

## Sorting

### Sort Options

Documents can be sorted by:

| Sort By | Description |
