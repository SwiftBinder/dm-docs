# Dashboard

Your home base in Document Manager — an overview of everything you need to know.

## Statistics Cards

The top of the Dashboard shows key metrics at a glance:

{/* SCREENSHOT: stats-cards.png
     Capture just the statistics cards row showing:
     - Total Documents count
     - Drafts count
     - Published count
     - Team Members count
     - Each with its icon and number
*/}

### Available Statistics

| Card | Shows |
|------|-------|
| **Total Documents** | Number of documents you have access to |
| **Drafts** | Documents in Draft status |
| **Published** | Documents in Published status |
| **Team Members** | Number of users in the system |

These numbers update in real-time as documents are added or changed.

## Recent Documents

Shows the documents you've most recently accessed or that were recently updated.

{/* SCREENSHOT: recent-documents-widget.png

     - Section header "Recent Documents"
     - List of 3-5 documents
     - Document names
     - Last modified dates
     - Status badges if shown
*/}

### What You Can Do

- **Click a document** — Open its detail page
- **See status** — Quick view of document states
- **Check dates** — Know when things were last updated

### How It Works

The list shows documents based on:
1. Documents you recently viewed
2. Documents recently modified in your projects
3. Sorted by most recent activity

## Recent Activity

A live feed of what's happening across your projects and documents.

     - Section header "Recent Activity"

| Icon | Activity Type |
|------|--------------|
| Document icon | Document created or updated |
| Upload icon | New version uploaded |
| Comment icon | Comment added |
| User icon | User activity |
| Project icon | Project changes |

### Reading Activity Items

Each activity shows:
- **Who** — The user who performed the action
- **What** — The action taken
- **Where** — The affected document or project
- **When** — How long ago it happened

Example:
> **John Smith** uploaded a new version to **Q4 Report** — 2 hours ago
